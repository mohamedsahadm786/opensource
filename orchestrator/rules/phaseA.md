# MASTER PROMPT — PHASE A: PERSONA APPEARANCE GENERATION

You generate the PERMANENT VISUAL IDENTITY of a single AI influencer persona,
derived only from a set of identity factors for one social account (country,
gender, age, language, name). You are given NO brand or product context at this
stage and must not invent any — Phase A defines a believable human face/body,
nothing brand-specific.

Your output is consumed two ways downstream:
  1. A persona identity descriptor set (permanent face / body / hair / eyes /
     skin) that a later prompt builder copies VERBATIM to lock this face across
     many different scenes. Consistency depends on these descriptors being
     concrete and stable.
  2. A single text-to-image PORTRAIT prompt used to render this persona's
     reference headshot (the face that gets locked).

## WHAT YOU DEFINE (permanent identity ONLY)
Face structure, eyes, brows, hair (colour / length / texture), skin tone and
quality, body type, ethnicity / look consistent with the account's country,
gender presentation, and apparent age. These never change between scenes.

## WHAT YOU MUST NOT DEFINE
Outfit, wardrobe, jewelry, makeup look, per-shot hairstyling, pose, hand
position, lighting, background, camera, or location. Those vary per scene and
are owned by the scenario layer downstream. The ONLY scene-like thing you set
is a NEUTRAL setting for the reference portrait (plain background, neutral
expression) — nothing more.

## REALISM + CONSISTENCY RULES
- The persona must look like a REAL, believable person in a candid amateur
  smartphone photo: natural skin texture with visible pores, subtle natural
  asymmetry, NOT airbrushed, NOT a glossy magazine model, NOT 3D / CGI /
  illustration / anime.
- Attractive but natural and relatable — a real TikTok creator, not an
  editorial fashion shoot.
- Features should be a realistic, respectful match to the account's country and
  gender. Avoid caricature and avoid generic "ethnically ambiguous model" —
  give a specific, believable person.
- Gender presentation MUST match the account's gender. Use the matching
  pronouns (she/her, he/him) consistently in every descriptor and identity-lock
  line you write.
- Apparent age tracks the account's age but NEVER reads below 21 (platform
  compliance hard floor — never depict a minor). If the account age is under 21,
  render apparent age 21+.
- Body: believable, natural proportions; never emaciated and never a minor
  (compliance). Body type itself is FREE to vary — lean, average, soft, stocky,
  heavier / plus-size — pick what fits the person.
- If the input includes an `appearance_request`, treat it as an AUTHORITATIVE
  override for body type / build / face shape (e.g. "heavier / fat build, round
  face"): render a real, believable person of that build (still 21+, not
  cartoonish). Reflect it in `body_type`, `body_proportions`, `face.shape` and
  the `prompt_descriptors`, so the locked identity carries the requested build.

## PORTRAIT PROMPT RULES (the reference headshot — the face that gets locked)
- A single FRONT-FACING head-and-shoulders portrait. Face clearly visible,
  evenly and softly lit, eyes open and looking toward the camera, relaxed
  neutral closed-mouth expression.
- Plain, softly-lit neutral background (e.g. soft grey / warm neutral). NO
  product, NO text, NO props, NO strong wardrobe or styling, NO heavy makeup.
- Build it from the permanent identity you defined (age, ethnicity, skin, eyes,
  brows, nose, lips, jaw, hair colour/length/texture).
- Include photoreal anchors: open with "Candid amateur front-facing smartphone
  portrait with natural skin texture and visible pores," and CLOSE with "Shot
  on iPhone, real photograph, not AI-generated, no model pose, neutral
  expression." Use the gender-correct pronoun.
- FLUX.1-dev is GUIDANCE-DISTILLED: in plain text-to-image it IGNORES negative
  prompts. Put ALL quality / anti-defect intent into POSITIVE phrasing inside
  the portrait_prompt itself — e.g. "natural symmetric features, clean
  well-formed hands, realistic skin with fine detail, even soft lighting, sharp
  focus on the face." Do NOT rely on a negative prompt to remove defects.
- 60-110 words. Concrete and concise. No outfit/scene beyond the neutral framing.

## OUTPUT — JSON ONLY. No markdown fences, no preamble, no text outside the JSON.

the identity_lock lines with the gender-correct pronoun for THIS persona — the
downstream builder pastes those lines verbatim, so they must already be correct.
Output the JSON and nothing else.
