src/qc_validator.py — image quality-control validator (BALANCED mode).

Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 (multimodal) to gate AI-generated product-ad images
before they go to the video pipeline.

KEY TECHNIQUE — DESCRIBE-THEN-JUDGE FOR LIMBS:
  A plain yes/no "is the hand malformed?" question is unreliable — the model
  tends to answer "false" on borderline cases. So for hands / palms / arms /
  legs the rubric FORCES the model to first WRITE OUT a description of each
  one (how many palms on each wrist, how many hands on each arm, any extra
  mass) and ONLY THEN set the boolean flags. Describing the defect out loud
  makes a wrong "clean" verdict far less likely. This applies to limbs only —
  finger-count and product checks are unchanged and stay lenient.

FAILS (image is regenerated):
  ANATOMY
    - more than 1 person
    - more than 2 arms / 2 hands / 2 legs (clear extras)
    - a malformed hand: a doubled palm, a second palm fused to the same
      wrist, an extra hand-mass growing out of one hand, or a hand/arm
      attached at an impossible place
    - a BLATANT extra-finger blunder: 7+ clearly visible fingers on one
      hand, or fingers fused into a single mass
    - limbs fused / twisted into physically impossible shapes
    - face grossly distorted or missing
  PLACEMENT (logical, not perfect)
    - hand/grip clearly illogical — product floating, impossible grip
    - leg/body pose physically absurd
  PRODUCT
    - no product visible at all
    - 2+ distinct product copies
    - box warped/melted into a non-rectangular impossible shape
    - brand name "ALLUVI" less than ~90% legible  (THE strict check)
    - product name "TIRZEPATIDE" less than ~70% resemblance (looser)
    - box structure/colour theme less than ~80%

ALWAYS PASSES (ignored — minor):
  - finger COUNT when fingers are hidden/masked by the product (NEVER fail
    for "too few" fingers)
  - tiny finger-curl weirdness, partial occlusion
  - minor lighting / colour drift, soft focus, slight blur
  - background imperfections
  - small text artifacts above the legibility thresholds
  - slightly imperfect but plausible poses

NOTE: product-orientation checking is intentionally NOT done here yet — it
will be added after the product LoRA, together with Option B (real product
reference image passed to QC).

COST:   ~$0.01 per image (Sonnet 4.5).
LATENCY: ~5-10s per check.

USAGE:
  from src.qc_validator import validate_image
  result = validate_image(Path("output/05_step2_final.jpg"))
  if result["passed"]:
      ...                          # send to video pipeline

QC_RUBRIC = """\
Review this image. Apply BALANCED standards: catch blunders, ignore minor
imperfections. When a flaw is small and the image still looks believable,
PASS it. BUT be strict and careful about hands, palms, arms and legs.

STEP 1 — DESCRIBE THE LIMBS (you must fill these in honestly and in detail;
this description is mandatory and comes BEFORE any judgement):
- limb_description.hands: describe every hand you can see. For EACH hand
  state: which arm/wrist it is on, how many palms are on that wrist (a
  normal wrist has exactly ONE palm), whether you see any extra palm,
  doubled palm, or extra hand-shaped mass attached to it.
- limb_description.arms: describe the arms — how many, where each connects
  to the body, and whether any arm is attached at an impossible place or
  bends impossibly.
- limb_description.legs: describe the legs — how many, and whether any leg
  is doubled, fused, or attached wrongly.

STEP 2 — JUDGE. Using your STEP 1 descriptions, answer each question. If
your description above mentions an extra/doubled palm or hand-mass, then
has_malformed_hand MUST be true.

ANATOMY:
1. person_count: how many distinct real people are visible? (must be 1)
2. has_extra_limbs: more than 2 arms, OR more than 2 legs, OR more than 2
   hands clearly visible? Ignore a limb partially hidden or cropped.
   (expected: false)
3. has_malformed_hand: based on STEP 1 — does any ONE hand have a doubled
   palm, a second palm on the same wrist, an extra hand-shaped mass, or a
   hand attached at an impossible place? (expected: false)
4. has_malformed_arm_or_leg: based on STEP 1 — is any arm or leg doubled,
   fused, bent in a physically impossible way, or attached at an impossible
   place on the body? (expected: false)
5. has_blatant_finger_blunder: does any ONE hand show 7 OR MORE clearly
   visible fingers, OR fingers fused into a single mass? If fingers are
   simply hidden behind the product, that is NORMAL — answer false. Do NOT
   flag low finger counts or slight curl. (expected: false)
6. face_grossly_distorted: is the face severely distorted, melted, doubled,
   or missing? Ignore minor asymmetry or soft focus. (expected: false)

PLACEMENT (logical, not perfect):
7. placement_illogical: is the way the person holds or is positioned with
   the product clearly ILLOGICAL — product floats unsupported, the grip is
   one no real hand could make, or the body pose is physically absurd? A
   slightly awkward but physically possible pose is FINE. (expected: false)

PRODUCT:
8. product_visible: is the Alluvi product box visible? (expected: true)
9. multiple_distinct_products: are there 2 OR MORE separate copies of the
   product box? (a mirror reflection does NOT count) (expected: false)
10. product_shape_broken: is the box warped, melted, or bent into a
    non-rectangular impossible shape? Minor perspective/angle is FINE.
    (expected: false)
11. brand_name_legible: the box should show "ALLUVI". Is "ALLUVI" at least
    90% legible — a viewer clearly reads it as ALLUVI (not "ARLUVI",
    "ALUUVI", or unreadable)? This is the STRICT check. (expected: true)
12. product_name_resemblance: the box should show "TIRZEPATIDE". Does the
    rendered text resemble "TIRZEPATIDE" by at least ~70% — recognisable
    even if a letter or two is off? (expected: true)
13. box_theme_ok: is the box a rectangular box with the correct colour
    theme (white base, blue wave graphic, green seal) at roughly 80%+?
    Exact content not required. (expected: true)

Then provide:
- specific_issues: short list of ONLY the real defects found. Each item a
  SHORT imperative phrase (e.g. "doubled palm on the left hand", "extra
  hand-mass on the right wrist", "brand name ALLUVI garbled"). Empty list
  if the image is acceptable.
- overall_recommendation: "use", "regenerate", or "discard"
- confidence: 0.0 to 1.0
