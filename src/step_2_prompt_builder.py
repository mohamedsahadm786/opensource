"""
src/step_2_prompt_builder.py — Qwen-tuned Step 2 prompt generation via Opus 4.7.

v6 — Research-tuned tagged-section structure (180-240 words, hard ceiling 280).

Key changes from v5 (in this version):
  - 6-section tagged structure: EDIT / PRODUCT / PRESERVE / ANATOMY / UNIQUENESS / LIGHTING
  - PRODUCT section quotes the exact product text strings verbatim (research:
    apiyi.com 23-test study showed quoting text raises Qwen rendering accuracy
    from 65% to 96%)
  - PRESERVE section is categorical only — no persona/outfit/scene re-description
    (the model already sees the first image; re-description dilutes attention
    AND creates contradictions when Stage 1 differs from scenario intent)
  - NEW ANATOMY clause — natural human anatomy without counting fingers.
    The old "five fingers per hand (one thumb plus four others) — fingers
    occluded still fully exist" caused Qwen to render visible extras around
    the product. The new clause explicitly forbids this.
  - Reduced word budget from 380-450 to 180-240 (target), hard ceiling 280.
    Research (apiyi, FAL, Replicate) consistently shows shorter prompts win
    for image-edit tasks; the 380-450 target was a hypothesis that didn't hold up.

Backward compatibility (intentionally preserved):
  - Function signature: build_step_2_prompt(scenario, step_1_output) -> dict
  - Returned dict's `step_2_image_prompt` key (used by step_2_qwen_edit.generate)
  - Returned dict's `fal_qwen_params.image_size` (consumed by step_2_qwen_edit)
  - Module path / import path unchanged
  - Static context loader unchanged
  - Anthropic client init unchanged
  - JSON parse defensive guard unchanged
